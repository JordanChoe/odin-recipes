<h2 class="desc">Description</h2>
This is a nice easy steak with mushrooms recipe, perfect for keto/ketovore, that adds flair with the garlic mushrooms.<br> Carnivores can omit garlic and mushrooms, and folks who eat more carbs can add a baked potato.<br>

<h2>Alternatives and Notes</h2>
<p>Want even <strong>TASTIER</strong> steak?  Try topping it with the <a href="chunkyguacamole.html">Chunky Guacamole!</a>.
<br>While I use ribeye, any steak or cut will work. You can substitute the butter for a different cooking fat.  Butter is just... <strong>YUM!!!</strong></p>
