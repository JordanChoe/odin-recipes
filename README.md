HTML recipes project, learning to code

First project in The Odin Project Foundations Course.

Completing this project will show a basic understanding of HTML boilerplate, anchors, links, images, and multiple pages. 

This project provides practical experience with git from the command line, and VSCode.  It will also create and embed personal workflow for basic design, commits, and possibly publishing.

After completing the project, learned I needed to find <br> commands to increase readability.  Typos are super important.  It is easy to add in elements and not notice how those affect spacing between sentences and lines. Keeping copies open in the browser to refresh after saving was quite helpful.  

While I made a copy of Oatmeal Peanut Butter Bars to use as a template for Chunky Guacamole, I am not sure it was that much quicker than when I wrote Ribeye with Bleu Cheese and Mushrooms from scratch.

Of note, there are still some files stating not staged for commit.  Those files were deleted or renamed in the repo, one of them replaced entirely.  I do need to do more reading on git to learn how to handle these types of changes.   

Those files have since been cleared out.  Following the instructions to publish, I noticed in my browser and direct link that the incorrect picture for the oatmeal bars was showing.  The M for modified meant that I never committed the replacement picture.  This allowed me to completely clear my git status command. :)
